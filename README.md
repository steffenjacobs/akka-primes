# Akka Prime number calculator

Run `me.steffenjacobs.akka.PrimeApp.main` and calculate the primes between 0 and 100. 

The result can be found in `./output.txt`. 

This code is based on a blogpost from 2016 in *German* which can be found [here](https://blog.oio.de/2016/12/22/aktorenmodell-und-akka-teil-23).
